TO DO:
SEARCHBAR
searchbar needs 404


ORGANIZATION
maybe use an index to group all the imports in app.js (its getting out of hand)

LYRICS
open in new window, as its shown in here : https://hackernoon.com/using-a-react-16-portal-to-do-something-cool-2a2d627b0202

REGISTRATION
should set location and radius in there


MINOR BUGS and ISSUES
need fixing on the yellow error messages
create an error for when the acc already exists
first 1 sec render of the 'un-authed' screen needs to go - must have to do with the async, auth function
gotta get rid of the pre renders, that render before the state updates
function that gets the bands on the app - component did mount should be in the api, need to find a way to make it wait for the user id before calling the other func (its passing down an unknown variable)
the delete function still gives a yellow warning on the browser console
tabs isnt super accurate
possibly in the myEvents artists like Drake White will show up if you follow Drake

MAJOR BUGS and ISSUES
bands with / on their name bug the app (eg: AC/DC)
drake comes up as undefined in the url, hes probably not the only one - REASON: thats because if the searchbar is not completed it will go to the uncompleted url
