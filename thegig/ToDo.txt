TO DO:
SEARCHBAR - not that important
searchbar needs 404
need to add on key down -enter


ORGANIZATION - not that important
maybe use an index to group all the imports in app.js (its getting out of hand)

LYRICS - not that important
open in new window, as its shown in here : https://hackernoon.com/using-a-react-16-portal-to-do-something-cool-2a2d627b0202

SETTINGS - somewhat important
we could use a message or popup after we update something

COMPONENTS THAT NEED ISLOADING - important
myEvents, events, setlists, followUnfollowButton

MYEVENTS - somewhat important
need to fix that thing for secondary acts like i did for the artist events
the reason why myevents is low might be because we're fetching 400 events

BillBoards - important
Should render hot100 by default

ARTICLES - important
all article divs should have the same size and be aligned
they also need a link to the article
bands with no news (eg: capitao fausto) should display a message and not the empty carousel. Also thats gonna need an isLoading

BANDINFO - important
could use "Bio" and "related artists" titles

SETLISTS - really important
some artists, drake for example, arent displaying setlists
also need to include encore
also need styling

DISCOGRAPHY - really important
name of artist not displaying correctly
order should be 123 - 456 and not 135-246 on the top rated albums
songtitle overlapping the number of plays in top rated albums
when you press "show more albums you should see all of the other albums, not just 10", and they should be organized in a grid, not a column

SONGPAGE - not that important
should add related songs


MINOR BUGS and ISSUES
need fixing on the yellow error messages
create an error for when the acc already exists
first 1 sec render of the 'un-authed' screen needs to go - must have to do with the async, auth function
gotta get rid of the pre renders, that render before the state updates
function that gets the bands on the app - component did mount should be in the api, need to find a way to make it wait for the user id before calling the other func (its passing down an unknown variable)
the delete function still gives a yellow warning on the browser console
tabs isnt super accurate
possibly in the myEvents artists like Drake White will show up if you follow Drake

MAJOR BUGS and ISSUES
bands with / on their name bug the app (eg: AC/DC)
drake comes up as undefined in the url, hes probably not the only one - REASON: thats because if the searchbar is not completed it will go to the uncompleted url
searchbar if you go from a song page to another it wont render, need that newprops thingy
