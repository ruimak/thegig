STILL NEEDS TO BE DONE------------------------

APP - IMPORTANT
settings still takes props

ORGANIZATION - not that important
maybe use an index to group all the imports in app.js (its getting out of hand)

LYRICS - not that important
open in new window, as its shown in here : https://hackernoon.com/using-a-react-16-portal-to-do-something-cool-2a2d627b0202

MYEVENTS - somewhat important
need to fix that thing for secondary acts like i did for the artist events

ARTICLES - important
bands with no news (eg: capitao fausto) should display a message and not the empty carousel. Also thats gonna need an isLoading
we still have that idiot drake bell, whoever that is, displayed amongst the drake news, need a filter

SETLISTS - really important
some artists, drake for example, arent displaying setlists
also need to include encore

DISCOGRAPHY - really important
show more albums should always render in a grid format

SONGPAGE - not that important
should add related songs
some songs crash, try some from billboards or change the name on url

MINOR BUGS and ISSUES
need to fix the errors on the browser log
check if theres an error for when the acc already exists
the delete function still gives a yellow warning on the browser console
tabs isnt super accurate

MAJOR BUGS and ISSUES
bands with / on their name bug the app (eg: AC/DC)

STYLING
mediaqueries

SECURITY
remove all keys from code




POSSIBLY DOESNT NEED TO BE DONE --------------------------------------


SEARCHBAR - not that important
searchbar needs 404
need to add on key down -enter
drake comes up as undefined in the url, hes probably not the only one - REASON: thats because if the searchbar is not completed it will go to the uncompleted url
