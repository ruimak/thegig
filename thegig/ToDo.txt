TO DO:
SEARCHBAR
searchbar always sends you directly to the most relevant band if you have typos or if the band doesnt exist, should fix to a 404 page with a suggestion link to the most selected page
it also should autocomplete onclick (change value={this.state.input}). But thats too slow, needs fixing
also possibly when we remove a band we may need to update the state in app


ARTIST NEWS
artist news should have a link to every single news piece content

SET RADIUS
its being set in setlocation but it should be in its own individual place


MINOR BUGS and ISSUES
keep getting the unique id key yellow message
create an error for when the acc already exists
first 1 sec render of the 'un-authed' screen needs to go - must have to do with the async, auth function
function that gets the bands on the app - component did mount should be in the api, need to find a way to make it wait for the user id before calling the other func (its passing down an unknown variable)
the delete function still gives a yellow warning on the browser console

MAJOR BUGS and ISSUES
bands with / on their name bug the app (eg: AC/DC)
if we go straight to the links like http://localhost:3000/Red%20Hot%20Chili%20Peppers/info/ instead of getting there by clicking, we re not passing down props hence it crashes. we can use "window.location", or "props.match.params" and make a new request / with regex probably


POSSIBLE FIXING TO THE REFRESH-INPUT URL PROBLEM:
look at the album.jsx. That one works. Should we get all info from params other than props? Whats the point of props then
