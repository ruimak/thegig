TO DO:
SEARCHBAR
searchbar needs 404

SPOTIFY
cant take props. There is a key there in the state and a func gethashparams that we can maybe used to check wether the user is logged in or not

ORGANIZATION
maybe use an index to group all the imports in app.js (its getting out of hand)

LYRICS
open in new window, as its shown in here : https://hackernoon.com/using-a-react-16-portal-to-do-something-cool-2a2d627b0202

REGISTRATION
should set location and radius in there

BILLBOARDS
the billboards are too slow, need to check why

MINOR BUGS and ISSUES
keep getting the unique id key yellow message
create an error for when the acc already exists
first 1 sec render of the 'un-authed' screen needs to go - must have to do with the async, auth function
function that gets the bands on the app - component did mount should be in the api, need to find a way to make it wait for the user id before calling the other func (its passing down an unknown variable)
the delete function still gives a yellow warning on the browser console


MAJOR BUGS and ISSUES
bands with / on their name bug the app (eg: AC/DC)
drake comes up as undefined in the url, hes probably not the only one - REASON: thats because if the searchbar is not completed it will go to the uncompleted url
