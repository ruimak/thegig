TO DO:
SEARCHBAR - not that important
searchbar needs 404
need to add on key down -enter

APP - IMPORTANT
need to route an error page
settings still takes props


ORGANIZATION - not that important
maybe use an index to group all the imports in app.js (its getting out of hand)

LYRICS - not that important
open in new window, as its shown in here : https://hackernoon.com/using-a-react-16-portal-to-do-something-cool-2a2d627b0202

SETTINGS - somewhat important
we could use a message or popup after we update something

MYEVENTS - somewhat important
need to fix that thing for secondary acts like i did for the artist events
the reason why myevents is low might be because we're fetching 400 events

ARTICLES - important
need a link to the article
bands with no news (eg: capitao fausto) should display a message and not the empty carousel. Also thats gonna need an isLoading

BANDINFO - important
could use "related artists" titles

SETLISTS - really important
some artists, drake for example, arent displaying setlists
also need to include encore

DISCOGRAPHY - really important
name of artist not displaying correctly
order should be 123 - 456 and not 135-246 on the top rated albums
songtitle overlapping the number of plays in top rated albums
when you press "show more albums you should see all of the other albums, not just 10", and they should be organized in a grid, not a column

SONGPAGE - not that important
should add related songs

SETLOCATIONONAUTH - not important
may be able to delete a couple of things there cause we re not using it to update radius

MINOR BUGS and ISSUES
need fixing on the yellow error messages
create an error for when the acc already exists
function that gets the bands on the app - component did mount should be in the api, need to find a way to make it wait for the user id before calling the other func (its passing down an unknown variable)
the delete function still gives a yellow warning on the browser console
tabs isnt super accurate

MAJOR BUGS and ISSUES
bands with / on their name bug the app (eg: AC/DC)
drake comes up as undefined in the url, hes probably not the only one - REASON: thats because if the searchbar is not completed it will go to the uncompleted url
